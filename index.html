                        <h5>You can't BE what you can't SEE</h5>
                        <p>It's a phrase we hear time and time again when talking about young people and their future careers. In manufacturing and engineering—an industry filled with innovation, opportunity, and growth—too many students simply don't know what's out there.  No wonder we have a skills shortage.</p>

It will be your opportunity to showcase your business and influence young minds through interactive “touchy feely” displays.</p>
