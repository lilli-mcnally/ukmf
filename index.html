                        <p>It's a phrase we hear time and time again when talking about young people and their future careers. In manufacturing and engineering—an industry filled with innovation, opportunity, and growth—too many students simply don't know what's out there.  No wonder we have a skills shortage.</p>

                        <p>West Midlands Manufacturing Festival is more than an event—it's a mission. A mission to inspire the next generation, educate the educators, and open doors to careers students may never have considered. It will be your opportunity to showcase your business and influence young minds through interactive “touchy feely” displays.</p>
