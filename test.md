#### Contact Us Form Testing

Initial submission of an empty field went to the default Formspree link asking for at least the name field to be filled in. I realised I had missed the <code>required</code> attribute so this has now been added.

Further testing following this showed the form cannot be submitted until all boxes are complete. Upon submission, the test email address recieved an email from Formspree with the submission details. The submitted form's details have also been added to the Formspree database for this test account.
